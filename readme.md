High Jinks
==========
by Justin Elkan Jones

## <a name="introduction">1.  Introduction</a>

High Jinks is a competitive card game for 2-4 players using 1 (or 2) standard 52-card deck(s) plus Jokers.  Its game mechanics borrow heavily from popular trading card games.  Face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings and Jokers), alternatively referred to as **Agents**, are played to the field and are used to attack the opponent and to defend oneself from opponents’ attacks.  Number cards (2-10), alternatively referred to as **Mana cards**, are used to modify an Agent's Power with the objective of overcoming the **Power** of an opposing Agent.

## <a name="thefield">2.  The Field</a>

Each player owns 9 zones on the field, arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns.  The 1st row contains Agent zones and the 2nd and 3rd rows contain Mana card zones.  Thus a player may have no more than 3 Agents and 6 Mana cards on their side of the field at a time.  Each player must allocate table space for up to 5 Damage Counters.  There are 4 other locations on the playing surface (placed at the players' discretion) for card stacks accessible to all players.  They are:

- The **Deck**:

- The **Boneyard**: resting place for Mana cards.

- The **Bench**: resting place for Agents.  

- The **Void**: face-down stack with limited accessibility.  

A Mana card or Agent that is **discarded** is sent to the Boneyard or the Bench, respectively.  A card that is **banished** is sent face-down to the Void.  The order of the Bench is relevant and should not be altered during the game.

## <a name="drawphase">3.  Draw Phase</a>

Your turn begins with the **Draw Phase**, during which you draw 2 cards.  Every player skips the Draw Phase on their first turn (see section 27).

## <a name="mainphase">4.  Main Phase</a>

Following the draw is the **Main Phase**.  All non-combat activities, such as summoning an Agent, setting a Mana card, and casting a spell, are conducted during the Main Phase.

## <a name="summoningagents">5.  Summoning Agents</a>

During your Main Phase, you can **normal summon** an Agent from your hand to one of your unoccupied Agent zones (placed vertically and face-up).  When an Agent is normal summoned, its controller can either draw a card or activate its summon ability (see section 18).  You are allowed 1 free normal summon per turn.  You can **retire** (discard) an Agent from your side of the field to earn an additional normal summon.  

You can also **special summon** an Agent from your hand to your side of the field.  It enters the field **tapped** (placed horizontally and face-up).  An Agent cannot attack the turn it is special summoned, and its summon ability does not activate.  

Each individual Agent card may only be summoned (normal or special) once per turn.

## <a name="settingmanacards">6.  Setting Mana Cards</a>

During your Main Phase, you can **set** a Mana card from your hand to one of your unoccupied Mana zones (placed vertically and face-down).  It is then available to be used to empower an Agent in the combat phase (see section 9).  Deuces (2s) can never be set or placed in a Mana card zone in any way (see section 13).

## <a name="combatphase">7.  Combat Phase</a>

The Main Phase is followed by an optional **Combat Phase**, during which the turn player can attack opponents.  An attack proceeds in 4 steps:

i)  The turn player declares an attack against any opponent with an untapped Agent they control.  The attacking Agent becomes tapped (turned from vertical to horizontal).

ii)  The opponent being attacked may block the attack with one of their own Agents.  The corresponding attacker and defender are then considered to be “dueling”.

iii)  **Damage step**: An unblocked attacker deals damage (see section 8).  Dueling Agents can be empowered (see sections 9 and 10), after which the Agent with the lower Power is **defeated** (sent to the Bench).  See section 11 for determining the outcome of ties.

iv)  Each Agent remaining on the field that dueled gains a Battle Scar (see section 25).  (An unblocked attacker is not given a Battle Scar).

## <a name="dealingdamage">8.  Dealing Damage</a>

If an attacker is unchallenged by a defender, it attacks the opponent directly and the defending player is dealt a **Damage Counter**.  He or she picks up the top card of the Deck and places it face-up in their Damage Counter zone.  __*You lose the game when you accrue 6 Damage Counters*__.  Thus the objective of High Jinks is to deal damage to your opponent(s) while resisting attack.  Mana cards and Agents dealt as Damage Counters are available to the player as single-use resources (see sections 18 and 24).

## <a name="duels">9.  Duels</a>

During the Damage Step, each player involved in the duel is allowed the opportunity to **empower** their Agent using Mana cards.  A Mana card on the field that has not yet been used this turn can be tapped (turned vertical to horizontal) to empower the dueling Agent by the value of the card.  A face-down Mana card used in this way is flipped face-up, and remains face-up until removed from the field.  A Mana card in the hand may also be used to empower a dueling Agent by discarding that Mana card to the Boneyard.  Lastly, a face-up Mana card in the Damage Counter zone may be used to empower an Agent, after which it is flipped face-down.  Multiple Mana cards can be used to empower the same Agent in one duel; __*however, the sum of the Mana cards may not exceed 13*__; this is known as the **13 Rule**.

The attacking player is allowed to empower first.  When the player is finished playing Mana cards, they pass to the opponent who may then empower their Agent; and so play passes back and forth until both players pass, which concludes the duel.  The defeated Agent is sent to the Bench and the remaining Agent(s) is (are) given a Battle Scar (see section 25).

## <a name="suitbonus">10.  Suit Bonus</a>

When an Agent is empowered using a card of the same suit, it gains a **+1 Suit Bonus** for the duration of that duel.  This extra Power does not count against the 13 Rule, and multiple Suit Bonuses stack.

## <a name="tiebreakers">11.  Tiebreakers</a>

The outcome of a tie in the Damage Step is decided by the face values of the dueling Agents.  Each type of Agent has an advantage over another.  Kings defeat Queens, Queens defeat Jacks, and Jacks defeat Kings.  In a tie involving a Joker or two Agents of the same type, neither are defeated (both Agents remain on the field and receive a Battle Scar).

## <a name="endphase">12.  End Phase</a>

The turn ends with the **End Phase**.  At this time, all tapped cards on the field are untapped (turned back to vertical).  Play then passes clockwise to the next player.  

## <a name="deuces">13.  Deuces</a>

The deuce (the number card with value of 2) is not subject to the 13 Rule.  For example, if you have empowered your Agent with Mana cards whose values sum to 13, you can use a deuce to further empower that Agent to fifteen (plus any Power bonuses).  Deuces cannot be set in a Mana card zone; thus they can only be used to empower by discarding from the hand or flipping face-down as a Damage Counter.

## <a name="sixes">14.  Sixes</a>

During your Main Phase, you can banish a 6 from your hand or field to cast a **Conjuration spell**.  Declare a specific card; search the Void, and if it contains the declared card, add it to your hand.  You then receive 1 Damage Counter, unless you successfully conjure a card of the same suit as that of the 6 that you banished.

## <a name="sevens">15.  Sevens</a>

During your Main Phase, you can banish a 7 from your hand or field to cast an **Interception spell**.  Declare a specific card; if that card is in the hand of that opponent, banish it.  If the declared card shares the same suit of the 7 you banished, it is instead added to your hand.  If your opponent does not have the declared card, they must prove it by showing you their hand.  

## <a name="aces">16.  Aces</a>

Aces are powerful cards used only in the Combat Phase.  During the Damage Step, you can banish from your hand an Ace of the same suit as either of the dueling Agents to defeat the opponent’s Agent, regardless of those Agents’ Power.  However, the opponent may retaliate by banishing from their own hand an Ace of the appropriate suit to instead defeat your Agent.

## <a name="guildbonus">17.  Guild Bonus</a>

An Agent's Power can be increased with a **Guild Bonus**, which is applied when you control 3 Agents of a specific composition:
- Jack + Queen + King (multiple suits): +1
- Jack + Queen + King (same suit): +2
The Guild Bonus applies to all 3 Agents in the Guild and does not count against the 13 Rule.

## <a name="summonabilities">18.  Summon Abilities</a>

When you normal summon an Agent, you can either draw a card or activate that Agent’s **summon ability**.  Every Agent is granted an ability based on its face value:
- Jacks: Justice
- Queens: Lust
- Kings: Fortune

Descriptions of the summon abilities are as follows:

- **Justice**: When you summon a Jack, you can **destroy** a Mana card on an opponent’s field (that card is discarded to the Boneyard).

- **Lust**: When you summon a Queen, you can recruit an Agent from the Bench.

- **Fortune**: When you summon a King, you can **salvage** (add from the Boneyard to your hand) one card.  

During your main phase, you can flip face-down a face-up Agent that you have received as a Damage Counter to activate that Agent’s summon ability (a Joker can be used to activate any one of the three).

## <a name="suitabilities">19.  Suit Abilities</a>

Every Agent is granted an additional ability by its suit:
- Hearts: Abundance
- Diamonds: Wealth
- Clubs: Valor
- Spades: Ruin

Descriptions of the suit abilities are as follows:

- **Abundance**: When a Heart is defeated in a duel, its controller recruits the bottom card of the Bench.

- **Wealth**: When a Diamond is defeated in a duel, its controller draws 1 card, then discards the top card of the Deck.

- **Valor**: When a Club defeats an Agent in a duel, its controller can either draw or salvage 1 card.  

- **Ruin**: When an attacking Spade defeats an Agent in a duel, the defending player receives a Damage Counter.

When the suit abilities of both Agents involved in a duel would activate (i.e. a Club defeats a Diamond), the Agent that was defeated will apply its ability first.

**Kinship**: When Agents of the same suit duel, that suit ability does not activate.  So, for example, if a Spade is defeated by an attacking Spade, its controller does not take damage.

## <a name="jokers">20.  Jokers</a>

When you normal summon a Joker, you can activate any one of the three summon abilities.  A Joker acquires the suit (and suit ability) of the first Mana card used to empower it, for the duration of that duel.  Subsequent Mana cards played during that duel can grant suit bonuses.  A Joker can also be used to substitute for any Agent for the purposes of achieving a Guild Bonus.  You can use only 1 Joker to compose a Guild.

## <a name="pairsandbinaryspells">21.  Pairs and Binary Spells</a>

During your own Main Phase, you can banish a pair of Mana cards from your hand and/or field to cast one of three **Binary Spells**:

- **Transmutation**: Draw, salvage, and/or recruit 2 cards.

- **Infliction**: Burn (deal 1 Damage Counter to) an opponent of your choice.  No player can be burned for their 6th and final Damage Counter, and each player can be burned only once per turn (possibly for 2 damage at once, in the case of 4 of a Kind (see section 23)).

- **Restoration**: This allows you to heal a Damage Counter on the field.  If it belongs to you, it is discarded to the Bench or the Boneyard.  If you choose to heal an opponent’s Damage Counter, it is added to your hand.

## <a name="straights">22.  Straights</a>

During your main phase, you can discard from your hand and/or field a straight of 3 Mana cards (3 in a row) of any suit combination to draw 3 cards.  If all three cards in the straight are of the same suit, after drawing you can banish one of the discarded Mana cards to cast an **Evocation spell**.  Search the Deck and add 1 card of that suit to your hand.  Then shuffle the Deck and offer an opponent to cut it.  You may only evoke one card per suit per turn.

## <a name="fourofakind">23.  4 of a Kind</a>

During your Main Phase, you can banish from your hand and/or field **4 of a kind** of Mana cards (using all 4 suits) to cast each Binary Spell twice.  The spells can be cast in any order desired (e.g. a healed Damage Counter can be salvaged).

## <a name="damagecounters">24.  Damage Counters</a>

Face-up Mana cards dealt as Damage Counters can be used as if in your hand for the purposes of empowering an Agent, casting spells, or completing straits.  A Damage Counter used in this way is flipped face-down rather than being discarded or banished.  Aces dealt as Damage Counters cannot be used.  Face-down Damage Counters can still be viewed by the players.

## <a name="battlescars">25.  Battle Scars</a>

At the end of the Damage Step, each remaining Agent that dueled gains a **Battle Scar**.  (A 6-sided die works nicely for keeping track of an Agent's Battle Scars.) An Agent gains a **Glory Bonus** to its Power equal to half its number of Battle Scars, rounded down.  So, for example, an Agent with 3 Battle Scars has a +1 Glory Bonus, and an Agent with 6 Battle Scars has a Glory Bonus of +3.  Like the Guild Bonus, this extra Power does not count against the 13 Rule.  In addition, an Agent will acquire extra abilities as it accumulates Battle Scars:

- 3+: the Agent becomes a **Juggernaut**.  A Juggernaut is granted both Valor and Ruin (Club and Spade abilities).  It is treated as having these suits for the purpose of applying Kinship.

- 5+: the Agent becomes an **Archlord**.  Once per turn during your Main Phase, if you control an Archlord, you can banish from your hand a card of the same suit as that Archlord to cast a Binary Spell.

- 7: when your Agent gains its 7th Battle Scar, it becomes a **6th Dimensional Planet Smasher**, __*and you win the game, regardless of your opponents' damage count*__.

## <a name="losingthegame">26.  Losing the Game</a>

When you lose, if 2 or more players remain, the cards remaining in your hand are added to the hand of the player that dealt the final Damage Counter.  (If you lose due to time (see section 29), your hand is simply discarded).  Any cards remaining on your side of the field are sent to the Bench or the Boneyard, and your Damage Counters are banished to the Void.

**Redemption**: When you receive an Ace as your 6th Damage Counter, the Ace is added to your hand, and you continue play with 5 Damage Counters.

## <a name="gamesetup">27.  Game Setup</a>

At the game's outset, one of the players must be appointed as the dealer.  The dealer shuffles the Deck and deals 9 cards to each player.  Each player then chooses six of those cards to form their starting hand and sets aside the remaining three face-down.  When all players have finished choosing their starting hands, the dealer picks up the rejected cards and discards them to the Boneyard/Bench.  The player to the dealer's left gets the first turn, and thenceforth turn order proceeds clockwise.  During your first turn, you skip your Draw Phase, and you may not enter the Combat Phase, unless you are the dealer (last in turn order).  

## <a name="deckingout">28.  Decking Out</a>

In longer games, the Deck might run out.  Immediately after the last card of the Deck is drawn or received as a Damage Counter, the turn player combines the Void and the Bench and thoroughly shuffles them together to constitute a new Deck.  In a game of 3 or 4 players, High Jinks should be played with 2 Decks and 4 Jokers.  This greatly reduces the frequency of the Deck running out.  

## <a name="playingundertime">29.  Playing Under Time</a>

In games between proficient players, it is advisable to play with a timer in order to speed up game play and reward players for fast decision-making.  The amount of time given to each player should be discussed and agreed upon before the game begins.  After this initial time period has expired, that player immediately receives a Damage Counter.  Another Damage Counter is received at regular intervals thereafter.  The suggested duration for the initial period is 15 minutes, with a subsequent interval of 2 or 3 minutes.  A chess timer is perfectly suitable for games of 2 players.  Time is run down continuously for the turn player, with the exception of the Damage Step, when play is being passed back and forth between the attacking and defending opponents.

## <a name="notetaking">30.  Note Taking</a>

Much of the skill in High Jinks is in memory.  Once you have become proficient with the game mechanics, it is advisable to start noting on paper which cards have been played.  This will streamline your decision-making and relieve some frustration.  It will also build your memorization skills, preparing you for truly competitive games, which of course are played without notes.
