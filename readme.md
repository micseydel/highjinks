<span class="c0 c9">High Jinks</span><span class="c1"> </span>

<span class="c1">by Justin Elkan Jones</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>1\.  </span><span class="c1">Introduction</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>High Jinks is a competitive card game for 2-4 players using 1 (or 2) standard 52-card deck(s) plus Jokers.  Its game mechanics borrow heavily from popular trading card games.  Face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings and Jokers), alternatively referred to as</span> <span class="c0">Agents</span><span>, are played to the field and are used to attack the opponent and to defend oneself from opponents’ attacks.  Number cards (2-10), alternatively referred to as</span> <span class="c0">Mana cards</span><span>, are used to modify an Agent's</span> <span class="c0">Power</span><span class="c1"> with the objective of overcoming the Power of an opposing Agent.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">2\.  The Field</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Each player owns 9 zones on the field, arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns.  The 1st row contains Agent zones and the 2nd and 3rd rows contain Mana card zones.  Thus a player may have no more than 3 Agents and 6 Mana cards on their side of the field at a time.  Each player must allocate table space for up to 5 Damage Counters.  There are 4 other locations on the playing surface (placed at the players' discretion) for card stacks accessible to all players.  They are:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>- The</span> <span class="c0">Deck</span><span class="c1">: from which cards are drawn and Damage Counters received.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>- The</span> <span class="c0">Boneyard</span><span class="c1">: resting place for Mana cards.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>- The</span> <span class="c0">Bench</span><span class="c1">: resting place for Agents.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>- The</span> <span class="c0">Void</span><span class="c1">: face-down stack with limited accessibility.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>A Mana card or Agent that is</span> <span class="c0">discarded</span><span>is sent to the Boneyard or the Bench, respectively.  A card that is</span> <span class="c0">banished</span><span class="c1"> is sent face-down to the Void.  The order of the Bench is relevant and should not be altered during the game.  A great diagram of the playing field can be found here: http://i.imgur.com/wd8RUfv.png</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">3\.  Draw Phase</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>Your turn begins with the</span> <span class="c0">Draw Phase</span><span class="c1">, during which you draw 2 cards.  Every player skips the Draw Phase on their first turn (see section 27).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">4\.  Main Phase</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>Following the draw is the</span> <span class="c0">Main Phase</span><span class="c1">.  All non-combat activities, such as summoning an Agent, setting a Mana card, and casting a spell, are conducted during the Main Phase.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">5\.  Summoning Agents</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>During your Main Phase, you can</span> <span class="c0">normal summon</span><span>an Agent from your hand to one of your unoccupied Agent zones (placed vertically and face-up).  When an Agent is normal summoned, its controller can either draw a card or activate its summon ability (see section 18).  You are allowed 1 free normal summon per turn.  You can</span> <span class="c0">retire</span><span class="c1"> (discard) an Agent from your side of the field to earn an additional normal summon.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>You can also</span> <span class="c0">special summon</span><span>an Agent from your hand to your side of the field.  It enters the field</span> <span class="c0">tapped</span><span class="c1"> (placed horizontally and face-up).  An Agent cannot attack the turn it is special summoned, and its summon ability does not activate.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Each individual Agent card may only be summoned (normal or special) once per turn.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">6\.  Setting Mana Cards</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>During your Main Phase, you can</span> <span class="c0">set</span><span class="c1"> a Mana card from your hand to one of your unoccupied Mana zones (placed vertically and face-down).  It is then available to be used to empower an Agent in the combat phase (see section 9).  Deuces (2s) can never be set or placed in a Mana card zone in any way (see section 13).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">7\.  Combat Phase</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>The Main Phase is followed by an optional</span> <span class="c0">Combat Phase</span><span class="c1">, during which the turn player can attack opponents.  An attack proceeds in 4 steps:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">i)  The turn player declares an attack against any opponent with an untapped Agent they control.  The attacking Agent becomes tapped (turned from vertical to horizontal).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">ii)  The opponent being attacked may block the attack with one of their own Agents.  The corresponding attacker and defender are then considered to be “dueling”.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>iii)  </span><span class="c0">Damage step</span><span>: An unblocked attacker deals damage (see section 8).  Dueling Agents can be empowered (see sections 9 and 10), after which the Agent with the lower Power is</span> <span class="c0">defeated</span><span class="c1"> (sent to the Bench).  See section 11 for determining the outcome of ties.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">iv)  Each Agent remaining on the field that dueled gains a Battle Scar (see section 25).  (An unblocked attacker is not given a Battle Scar).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">8\.  Dealing Damage</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>If an attacker is unchallenged by a defender, it attacks the opponent directly and the defending player is dealt a</span> <span class="c0">Damage Counter</span><span>.  He or she picks up the top card of the Deck and places it face-up in their Damage Counter zone.  </span><span class="c4">You lose the game when you accrue 6 Damage Counters</span><span class="c1">.  Thus the objective of High Jinks is to deal damage to your opponent(s) while resisting attack.  Mana cards and Agents dealt as Damage Counters are available to the player as single-use resources (see sections 18 and 24).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">9\.  Duels</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>During the Damage Step, each player involved in the duel is allowed the opportunity to</span> <span class="c0">empower</span><span>their Agent using Mana cards.  A Mana card on the field that has not yet been used this turn can be tapped (turned vertical to horizontal) to empower the dueling Agent by the value of the card.  A face-down Mana card used in this way is flipped face-up, and remains face-up until removed from the field.  A Mana card in the hand may also be used to empower a dueling Agent by discarding that Mana card to the Boneyard.  Lastly, a face-up Mana card in the Damage Counter zone may be used to empower an Agent, after which it is flipped face-down.  Multiple Mana cards can be used to empower the same Agent in one duel;</span> <span class="c4">however, the sum of the Mana cards may not exceed 13</span><span>; this is known as the</span> <span class="c0">13 Rule</span><span class="c1">.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">The attacking player is allowed to empower first.  When the player is finished playing Mana cards, they pass to the opponent who may then empower their Agent; and so play passes back and forth until both players pass, which concludes the duel.  The defeated Agent is sent to the Bench and the remaining Agent(s) is (are) given a Battle Scar (see section 25).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">10\.  Suit Bonus</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>When an Agent is empowered using a card of the same suit, it gains a +1</span> <span class="c0">Suit Bonus</span><span class="c1"> for the duration of that duel.  This extra Power does not count against the 13 Rule, and multiple Suit Bonuses stack.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">11\.  Tiebreakers</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">The outcome of a tie in the Damage Step is decided by the face values of the dueling Agents.  Each type of Agent has an advantage over another.  Kings defeat Queens, Queens defeat Jacks, and Jacks defeat Kings.  In a tie involving a Joker or two Agents of the same type, neither are defeated (both Agents remain on the field and receive a Battle Scar).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">12\.  End Phase</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>The turn ends with the</span> <span class="c0">End Phase</span><span class="c1">.  At this time, all tapped cards on the field are untapped (turned back to vertical).  Play then passes clockwise to the next player.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">13\.  Deuces</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">The deuce (the number card with value of 2) is not subject to the 13 Rule.  For example, if you have empowered your Agent with Mana cards whose values sum to 13, you can use a deuce to further empower that Agent to fifteen (plus any Power bonuses).  Deuces cannot be set in a Mana card zone; thus they can only be used to empower by discarding from the hand or flipping face-down as a Damage Counter.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">14\.  Sixes</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>During your Main Phase, you can banish a 6 from your hand or field to cast a</span> <span class="c0">Conjuration spell</span><span class="c1">.  Declare a specific card; search the Void, and if it contains the declared card, add it to your hand.  You then receive 1 Damage Counter, unless you successfully conjure a card of the same suit as that of the 6 that you banished.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">15\.  Sevens</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>During your Main Phase, you can banish a 7 from your hand or field to cast an</span> <span class="c0">Interception spell</span><span class="c1">.  Declare a specific card; if that card is in the hand of that opponent, banish it.  If the declared card shares the same suit of the 7 you banished, it is instead added to your hand.  If your opponent does not have the declared card, they must prove it by showing you their hand.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">16\.  Aces</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Aces are powerful cards used only in the Combat Phase.  During the Damage Step, you can banish from your hand an Ace of the same suit as either of the dueling Agents to defeat the opponent’s Agent, regardless of those Agents’ Power.  However, the opponent may retaliate by banishing from their own hand an Ace of the appropriate suit to instead defeat your Agent.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">17\.  Guild Bonus</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>An Agent's Power can be increased with a</span> <span class="c0">Guild Bonus</span><span class="c1">, which is applied when you control 3 Agents of a specific composition:</span>

<span class="c1">- Jack + Queen + King (multiple suits): +1</span>

<span class="c1">- Jack + Queen + King (same suit): +2</span>

<span class="c1">The Guild Bonus applies to all 3 Agents in the Guild and does not count against the 13 Rule.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">18\.  Summon Abilities</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>When you normal summon an Agent, you can either draw a card or activate that Agent’s</span> <span class="c0">summon ability</span><span class="c1">.  Every Agent is granted an ability based on its face value:</span>

<span class="c1">- Jacks: Justice</span>

<span class="c1">- Queens: Lust</span>

<span class="c1">- Kings: Fortune</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Descriptions of the summon abilities are as follows:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>-</span> <span class="c0">Justice</span><span>: When you summon a Jack, you can</span> <span class="c0">destroy</span><span class="c1"> a Mana card on an opponent’s field (that card is discarded to the Boneyard).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>-</span> <span class="c0">Lust</span><span class="c1">: When you summon a Queen, you can recruit an Agent from the Bench.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>-</span> <span class="c0">Fortune</span><span>: When you summon a King, you can</span> <span class="c0">salvage</span><span class="c1"> (add from the Boneyard to your hand) one card.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">During your main phase, you can flip face-down a face-up Agent that you have received as a Damage Counter to activate that Agent’s summon ability (a Joker can be used to activate any one of the three).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">19\.  Suit Abilities</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Every Agent is granted an additional ability by its suit:</span>

<span class="c1">- Hearts: Abundance</span>

<span class="c1">- Diamonds: Wealth</span>

<span class="c1">- Clubs: Valor</span>

<span class="c1">- Spades: Ruin</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Descriptions of the suit abilities are as follows:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>-</span> <span class="c0">Abundance</span><span class="c1">: When a Heart is defeated in a duel, its controller recruits the bottom card of the Bench.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>-</span> <span class="c0">Wealth</span><span class="c1">: When a Diamond is defeated in a duel, its controller draws 1 card, then discards the top card of the Deck.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>-</span> <span class="c0">Valor</span><span class="c1">: When a Club defeats an Agent in a duel, its controller can either draw or salvage 1 card.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>-</span> <span class="c0">Ruin</span><span class="c1">: When an attacking Spade defeats an Agent in a duel, the defending player receives a Damage Counter.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">When the suit abilities of both Agents involved in a duel would activate (i.e. a Club defeats a Diamond), the Agent that was defeated will apply its ability first.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c0">Kinship</span><span class="c1">: When Agents of the same suit duel, that suit ability does not activate.  So, for example, if a Spade is defeated by an attacking Spade, its controller does not take damage.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">20\.  Jokers</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">When you normal summon a Joker, you can activate any one of the three summon abilities.  A Joker acquires the suit (and suit ability) of the first Mana card used to empower it, for the duration of that duel.  Subsequent Mana cards played during that duel can grant suit bonuses.  A Joker can also be used to substitute for any Agent for the purposes of achieving a Guild Bonus.  You can use only 1 Joker to compose a Guild.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">21\.  Pairs and Binary Spells</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>During your own Main Phase, you can banish a pair of Mana cards from your hand and/or field to cast one of three</span> <span class="c0">Binary Spells</span><span class="c1">:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>-</span> <span class="c0">Transmutation</span><span class="c1">: Draw, salvage, and/or recruit 2 cards.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>-</span> <span class="c0">Infliction</span><span class="c1">: Burn (deal 1 Damage Counter to) an opponent of your choice.  No player can be burned for their 6th and final Damage Counter, and each player can be burned only once per turn (possibly for 2 damage at once, in the case of 4 of a Kind (see section 23)).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>-</span> <span class="c0">Restoration</span><span class="c1">: This allows you to heal a Damage Counter on the field.  If it belongs to you, it is discarded to the Bench or the Boneyard.  If you choose to heal an opponent’s Damage Counter, it is added to your hand.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">22\.  Straights</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>During your main phase, you can discard from your hand and/or field a straight of 3 Mana cards (3 in a row) of any suit combination to draw 3 cards.  If all three cards in the straight are of the same suit, after drawing you can banish one of the discarded Mana cards to cast an</span> <span class="c0">Evocation spell</span><span class="c1">.  Search the Deck and add 1 card of that suit to your hand.  Then shuffle the Deck and offer an opponent to cut it.  You may only evoke one card per suit per turn.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">23\.  4 of a Kind</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>During your Main Phase, you can banish from your hand and/or field</span> <span class="c0">4 of a kind</span><span class="c1"> of Mana cards (using all 4 suits) to cast each Binary Spell twice.  The spells can be cast in any order desired (e.g. a healed Damage Counter can be salvaged).</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">24\.  Damage Counters</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Face-up Mana cards dealt as Damage Counters can be used as if in your hand for the purposes of empowering an Agent, casting spells, or completing straits.  A Damage Counter used in this way is flipped face-down rather than being discarded or banished.  Aces dealt as Damage Counters cannot be used.  Face-down Damage Counters can still be viewed by the players.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">25\.  Battle Scars</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>At the end of the Damage Step, each remaining Agent that dueled gains a</span> <span class="c0">Battle Scar</span><span>.  (A 6-sided die works nicely for keeping track of an Agent's Battle Scars.) An Agent gains a</span> <span class="c0">Glory Bonus</span><span class="c1"> to its Power equal to half its number of Battle Scars, rounded down.  So, for example, an Agent with 3 Battle Scars has a +1 Glory Bonus, and an Agent with 6 Battle Scars has a Glory Bonus of +3\.  Like the Guild Bonus, this extra Power does not count against the 13 Rule.  In addition, an Agent will acquire extra abilities as it accumulates Battle Scars:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>- 3+: the Agent becomes a</span> <span class="c0">Juggernaut</span><span class="c1">.  A Juggernaut is granted both Valor and Ruin (Club and Spade abilities).  It is treated as having these suits for the purpose of applying Kinship.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>- 5+: the Agent becomes an</span> <span class="c0">Archlord</span><span class="c1">.  Once per turn during your Main Phase, if you control an Archlord, you can banish from your hand a card of the same suit as that Archlord to cast a Binary Spell.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span>- 7: when your Agent gains its 7th Battle Scar, it becomes a</span> <span class="c0">6th Dimensional Planet Smasher</span><span>,</span> <span class="c4">and you win the game, regardless of your opponents' damage count</span><span class="c1">.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">26\.  Losing the Game</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">When you lose, if 2 or more players remain, the cards remaining in your hand are added to the hand of the player that dealt the final Damage Counter.  (If you lose due to time (see section 29), your hand is simply discarded).  Any cards remaining on your side of the field are sent to the Bench or the Boneyard, and your Damage Counters are banished to the Void.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c0">Redemption</span><span class="c1">: When you receive an Ace as your 6th Damage Counter, the Ace is added to your hand, and you continue play with 5 Damage Counters.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">27\.  Game Setup</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">At the game's outset, one of the players must be appointed as the dealer.  The dealer shuffles the Deck and deals 9 cards to each player.  Each player then chooses six of those cards to form their starting hand and sets aside the remaining three face-down.  When all players have finished choosing their starting hands, the dealer picks up the rejected cards and discards them to the Boneyard/Bench.  The player to the dealer's left gets the first turn, and thenceforth turn order proceeds clockwise.  During your first turn, you skip your Draw Phase, and you may not enter the Combat Phase, unless you are the dealer (last in turn order).  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">28\.  Decking Out</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">In longer games, the Deck might run out.  Immediately after the last card of the Deck is drawn or received as a Damage Counter, the turn player combines the Void and the Bench and thoroughly shuffles them together to constitute a new Deck.  In a game of 3 or 4 players, High Jinks should be played with 2 Decks and 4 Jokers.  This greatly reduces the frequency of the Deck running out.  </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">29\.  Playing Under Time</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">In games between proficient players, it is advisable to play with a timer in order to speed up game play and reward players for fast decision-making.  The amount of time given to each player should be discussed and agreed upon before the game begins.  After this initial time period has expired, that player immediately receives a Damage Counter.  Another Damage Counter is received at regular intervals thereafter.  The suggested duration for the initial period is 15 minutes, with a subsequent interval of 2 or 3 minutes.  A chess timer is perfectly suitable for games of 2 players.  Time is run down continuously for the turn player, with the exception of the Damage Step, when play is being passed back and forth between the attacking and defending opponents.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">30\.  Note Taking</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Much of the skill in High Jinks is in memory.  Once you have become proficient with the game mechanics, it is advisable to start noting on paper which cards have been played.  This will streamline your decision-making and relieve some frustration.  It will also build your memorization skills, preparing you for truly competitive games, which of course are played without notes.</span>
